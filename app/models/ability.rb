# = Attention: Conditional Abilities
#
#   can :manage, EventRating, person_id: user.person.id
#
# This means a user passes every check for EventRating the class, but may
# only :manage @event_rating if it belongs to her.
# see: https://github.com/ryanb/cancan/wiki/Checking-Abilities
#
#   "Important: If a block or hash of conditions exist they will be ignored
#   when checking on a class, and it will return true."
#
# As a solution, instead of manage, crud is used for the hash condition.
#
# Example:
#  can :crud, Conference, id: 1
#  can? :manage, Conference          => false
#  can? :administrate, Conference    => false
#  can? :create, Conference          => true
#  can? :read, @conference           => true
#
# = Wildcard Matching with :manage
#
# :manage matches all rules, if a custom rule exists and shall not be matched
# by :manage, then :crud can be used instead of :manage.
